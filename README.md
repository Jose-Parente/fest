This project provides a simple and intuitive API for functional testing of Swing user interfaces, resulting in tests 
that are compact, easy to write, and read like a specification. Tests written using FEST-Swing are also robust. 
FEST simulates actual user gestures at the operating system level, ensuring that the application will behave correctly in 
front of the user. It also provides a reliable mechanism for GUI component lookup that ensures that changes in the GUI's 
layout or look-and-feel will not break your tests.
